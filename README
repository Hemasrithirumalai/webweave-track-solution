What's Cookin'@SRM 🍛

An intuitive web solution to help SRM students view the daily canteen menu, plan meals, and avoid food confusion!

>> Problem Statement
Day scholars and students often face confusion about the daily canteen menu, leading to wasted time and effort. There's no real-time system to check what dishes are being served.

💡 Proposed Solution
We propose a centralized web portal displaying:
📅 Daily and weekly canteen menus  
🍛 Dish previews and short descriptions  
⭐ Optional feedback or ratings  
📱 User-friendly, responsive design

🎨 Current Progress
✅ Wireframe designed using *Figma*  
✅ Layout for **Menu Cards** and **Homepage** designed 

 📷 Screenshots / Preview



🛠️ Tech Stack (planned)
🧱 HTML, CSS (final build)  
🎨 Figma (for UI/UX prototyping)  
🛢️ Firebase or JSON (optional — for storing sample menu data)
